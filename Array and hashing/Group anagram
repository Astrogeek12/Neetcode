vector<vector<string> --->> 2D array
vector<string> -->> 1D arrray
So basically in this, we need to find the key which is the count of the characters in a string [for eat it is 1e,1a,1t] 
this is the key and the value will be the vector of strings which match the key for this we need to use a hashmap data structure

Time complexity is O(mn) m: The number of inputs, n: Length of each string
push_back function is used to add element in the end of the vector

str[j] - 'a' calculates the index of the character in the count vector. 
Since characters are represented as integers (ASCII values), 
subtracting the value of 'a' ('a' is 97 in ASCII) will give the index in the range of 0 to 25

auto is a keyword in C++ that allows the compiler to automatically deduce the data type of a variable 
based on its initializer. It is often used to simplify code and make it more readable by reducing the 
need to explicitly declare the data type of a variable
